# CWDAML and Adaptive CWDA

I had proposed and implemented 3 novel adaptive learning algorithms for time series data prediction and classification utilising modified linear and logistic regression techniques for optical communication receiver designs in my Ph.D. endeavour.This repository contains the Matlab code to simulate [1]Complex-Weighted Decision-Aided Maximum-Likelihood (CWDAML) and (2) Adaptive Complex-weighted Decision-Aided (Adaptive CWDA) algorithms for M-ary Phase-Shift Keying (MPSK) and M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (MQAM) modulation formats. 

For CWDAML:
- The codes will draw BER vs SNR graph.
- In the Matlab folder, you only have to modify the parameters in “Batch_file_16QAM.m” or "Batch_file_4PSK.m" which is the main file. The batch file will call all other files which are function files.
- For a start with my Matlab codes, you can simply run the batch file as-is without any modifications. It will produce a BER vs SNR graph corresponding to that of CWDAML algorithm. 
- The simulation will take several minutes to complete.

For Adaptive CWDA:
- Codes will be added soon.
